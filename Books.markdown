# Books I Enjoyed - James Lavin

## DESCRIPTION

I read (too) many books, especially since I began listening to audiobooks from my local library (which it offers free via [Overdrive](https://www.overdrive.com/)) and from Audible at 2.5x to 3.0x speed while exercising, folding laundry, washing pots, doing yardwork, driving, etc.

I was driven to audiobooks in late 2019, after suffering a detached retina. The (very successful) vitrectomy that saved my eye -- thank you again, Dr. Peter Weseley!!! -- induced a cataract that grew progressively worse until I fixed that with successful cataract surgery -- thank you, Dr. Peter Libre!!! For two years, between those surgeries, I couldn't focus both eyes at any distance and compensated by switching from dead-tree books to audiobooks. My happy accidental discovery of the joys of "reading" audiobooks has now blossomed into a habit... okay, an addiction. The only physical books I still read the old-fashioned way are inherently visual books, like technical books with code examples. I now do 95% of my text-based "reading" via audiobooks while accomplishing other tasks.

I have completed and enjoyed all the books below and would recommend them to anyone like me. Of course, you're not me, so YMMV. Books not marked "library" overcame a higher bar to make this list because I had to pay for them, so I vetted them carefully pre-purchase.

I encourage you to borrow audio or physical books from your local library or buy them from any retailer you choose. Personally, I first look for books through my library, then buy those I'm excited about but can't borrow. The key is to always be learning! Books empower you to learn things others have become experts at over many years in just a few hours. Their hard-earned, distilled wisdom just flows into your eyes or ears. It's incredible!

If you do sign up for Audible, learn how to stretch your dollar. I have a membership but save most of my credits for two-for-one or three-for-two specials. You can also buy a book for $3 to $6 via the daily special or during occasional sales. Search in your favorite search engine for "save money Audible" or "Audible insider tips" for more information.
